# GoogleLinks

Hello!

- This is a script I built to generate an excel sheet with sections for **titles** and **links**.
- For retrieving the Google search results, I used [rapidapi](https://rapidapi.com/hub) and [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
- If you want to use the Google search results api, you can add the 'x-rapidapi-key' to a '.env' file. Here is the [documentation](https://rapidapi.com/apigeek/api/google-search3/) to get started.
- To use this, enter your search query and then the number of search results you want in your excel sheet.

## Web app

- The link to the web app [GoogleLinks](https://links-cf02b.web.app/)
- The web app was created using React
- It contains home and contact section
  1) Home section you can find a form where you can enter your search query and number of search results you want in your excel file and click the button to download the file.
  2) Contact section is where you can write a message to me for any issues, question or any type of feedback

## This is an example of what the excel file might look like
