# GoogleLinks

Hello!
- This is a script I built to generate an excel sheet with sections for <b>titles</b> and <b>links</b>. <br>
- For retrieving the Google search results, I used [rapidapi](https://rapidapi.com/hub) and [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).<br>
- If you want to use the Google search results api, you can add the 'x-rapidapi-key' to a '.env' file. Here is the [documentation](https://rapidapi.com/apigeek/api/google-search3/) to get started. <br>
- To use this, enter your desired search and then the number of search results you want in your excel sheet.
