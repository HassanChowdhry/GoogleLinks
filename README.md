# GoogleLinks

Hello!
- This is script that I wrote to create an excel sheet with a section for both the <b>titles</b> and <b>links</b>. <br>
- I used [rapidapi](https://rapidapi.com/hub) and [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for fetching the google search results.<br>
- Here is the [documentation](https://rapidapi.com/apigeek/api/google-search3/) for the google search results api, if u want to use it too, you can add the 'x-rapidapi-key' to a '.env' file.
- To use this you need to enter your desired search and then how many search results would you want in your excel sheet
